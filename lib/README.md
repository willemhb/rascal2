The modules in this library serve the following purposes:

 * provide a rational set of compact, explicitly sized types
 * provide general numeric utilities (finding limits, advanced modular/logarithmic arithmetic, floating-point bit manipulation)
 * provide general string utilities  (string size, generic int and float reading procedures)
 * provide a unicode-compatible replacement for the builtin character and string utilities
 * provide a unicode-compatible, generic IO stream type
