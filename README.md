# rascal2

A disorganized passion project to create a modernized lisp someone would actually be interested in using. This is a long way from finished, largely because I'm still learning what I'm doing.

Depending on your point of view, this is either "Clojure but not on the JVM" or "Julia without all the unnecessary syntax" or
"Functional Python, also without all the unnecessary syntax".

Mostly though, this is a platform for me to figure out how to implement the language features I think are really beautiful. I
would like it someday to maybe have an actual public release, but I would like a lot of things.
